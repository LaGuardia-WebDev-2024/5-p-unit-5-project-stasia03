<h3>
  The Annual Riverside Concert is a performance where all vocal majors in all grades come together to Riverside Church and perform the pieces that we have learned in our choirs.

The day of the concert, every vocal majors schedule is slightly changed. We are blacked for 2-3 periods, and during that time the choir you are in travels to the Church via subway, then spend the rest of the remaining blackout time to rehearse the music and how to properly walk on stage in rows. After, you travel back to the school and continue your day. In my opinion, I know many people dont like the riverside concert because of how long the day is, but I love to see all the choirs at school showing off what theyve been working on. I love choirs, so I love seeing the level in skill in every choir throughout the years. Also, sometimes you dont see other choirs perform so this concert is like a free performance
